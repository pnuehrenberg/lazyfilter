# lazyfilter

This repository implements convenient and updateable filters (value/quantile ranges and value selections) for pandas dataframes.

Filters can be dependent on other filters and track their available value (ranges).

These filters are used in the [interactive-table](https://github.com/pnuehrenberg/interactive-table) package.
